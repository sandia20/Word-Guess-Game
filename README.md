# Word-Guess-Game

    1 - Add a button to start the game that when clicked it will play the js. file -- DONE
    2 - I need to pre-select the words that the user needs to guess and 
        have them on an array -- DONE
    3 - I need to display the word selected randomly from my list on the display 
        spaced like ' _ _ _ _ _' -- DONE
    4 - I need to set a limit of the number of letters to guess and count them down every
        time a letter is key down and display the remaining guess times -- DONE
    5 - I need to show the letter that the user entered on the display
    6 - Make sure that the letter entered by the user cannot be use again within the same word game
    7 - Every time the user guesses the correct letters, I need to reveal the letters on the spaces 
        designated for the word being guessed
    8 - The user will win if the entire word is guess before the remaining guess times is over
    9 - The Win counter will increment every time the user wins and a sound or song will play
        to celebrate the win
    10- If the guess times is 0 and the word has not been guessed, the user will lose and I need to 
        show the losses on the display and a sound will play
    11- After the user wins/loses the game should automatically choose another word and make the user 
        play it.
